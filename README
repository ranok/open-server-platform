Open Server Platform (OSP) is an open source (MIT License) project to make it easier to create secure, multi-threaded servers that can be distributed (onto the cloud even). You can find more information about OSP at http://www.openserverplatform.com. The main repository is on Google Code, but since SVN is such a nightmare to use, the bleeding edge code will be kept here, and puch to Google every time something big happens.
